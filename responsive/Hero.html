                    <img class="movie_post" src="images/Narutovspain.jpeg" alt="Naruto vs Pain">
                    <p>The Pain Arc marks a turning point in Naruto Shippuden, where Naruto returns to the Hidden Leaf
                        to face Pain,
                        the leader of the Akatsuki. After witnessing the destruction of the village and the death of his
                        mentor Jiraiya,
                        Naruto confronts Pain in a battle that tests his ideals and strength. Ultimately, Naruto
                        triumphs not only through
                        power but by understanding Pain’s trauma and convincing him to seek peace, solidifying his role
                        as the village’s hero.</p>

                    <img class="movie_post" src="images/sasuke_ven.jpeg" alt="Sasuke vengeance">
                    <p>Following the the pain arc, the story delves deeper into Sasuke’s path of vengeance and the
                        growing
                        threat of the
                        Akatsuki. The Five Kage Summit is held in response to Akatsuki's actions, where Sasuke clashes
                        with
                        several Kage. This
                        leads to the declaration of the Fourth Great Ninja War by Obito Uchiha (posing as Madara),
                        aiming to
                        capture all Tailed
                        Beasts and cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi—a genjutsu to trap the world in an illusion.</p>

                    <img class="movie_post" src="images/naruto_war.jpeg" alt="Great Ninja War">
                    <p>As the war erupts, Naruto trains to control the Nine-Tails’ chakra and gains immense power. On
                        the
                        battlefield,
                        countless ninja fight against reanimated legends and the Ten-Tails. The true Madara Uchiha
                        returns and
                        unleashes
                        chaos, eventually leading to the revival of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, the original wielder of chakra.
                        Naruto and
                        Sasuke,
                        chosen by the Sage of Six Paths, gain new powers to stop her.</p>

                    <p>The arc concludes with an emotional and intense final battle between Naruto and Sasuke at the
                        Valley of
                        the End. After
                        clashing ideologies and fists, they reconcile, ending the cycle of hatred. The war ends with
                        Naruto
                        hailed as a
                        savior—his dream of peace and unity finally within reach.</p>
