            <h1 class="heading_style">Legacy – Naruto’s Journey and Impact</h1>
            <p>Naruto’s journey spans years of intense battles, emotional growth, and life-changing friendships. 
                One of his first major milestones occurs during the Chunin Exams, where he surprises everyone by 
                defeating Neji Hyuga, a skilled prodigy. This marks the beginning of his transformation from a class 
                clown to a serious contender in the ninja world. Soon after, he begins training with the legendary Jiraiya, 
                one of the Three Sannin, who becomes a father figure to him. Naruto’s determination only grows as he faces off 
                against increasingly powerful enemies. He’s tested time and again, but his faith in himself—and his dream—remains 
                unshaken. His fight to bring Sasuke back from darkness becomes one of the most emotional arcs in the series, 
                showing Naruto’s deep loyalty to his friends.

            <h3 class="heading_style">Naruto’s most defining moment</h3>
            <p>One of Naruto’s most defining moments happens during the Pain Invasion Arc. After mastering Sage Mode, Naruto returns 
                to a destroyed Hidden Leaf Village and defeats the powerful villain Pain. But instead of seeking revenge, 
                he listens to Pain’s story and offers him a chance at redemption. This act of mercy and understanding earns 
                Naruto the respect of the entire village. For the first time, the people who once feared him see him as a hero. That 
                turning point is one of the most powerful moments in the series. It shows how far Naruto has come—not just in 
                strength, but in heart. He becomes a symbol of peace and forgiveness.</p>

                  loss, and hardship, but also love, joy, and triumph. Naruto shows that true strength lies not just in power, but in 
                  never giving up on people. Whether you're facing personal battles or chasing your dreams, Naruto reminds us to keep 
                  moving forward. As he always says—believe it!</p>
