            <img class="movie_post" src="images/naruto.jpg" alt="Naruto Uzumaki">

            <p>Naruto Uzumaki is the spirited and determined ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village who dreams of becoming
                Hokage—the
                strongest ninja and leader of the village. Born as the host of the Nine-Tails fox spirit, he grew up
                shunned and
                isolated by those around him, yet he never allowed hatred to take root in his heart. Through hard work,
                relentless
                optimism, and a refusal to give up, Naruto transforms from an outcast into one of the most respected
                shinobi in the
                world. His loyalty to his friends, especially Sasuke, drives many of his toughest battles and emotional
                moments. Under
                the guidance of mentors like Kakashi and Jiraiya, Naruto learns powerful techniques like the Rasengan
                and Sage Mode,
                and ultimately gains control over the Nine-Tails within him. He inspires those around him with his
                unshakable belief
                that even the most broken people can change for the better. Naruto's journey is one of personal growth,
                overcoming
                hardship, and redefining what it means to be a hero. By the end of his story, he not only fulfills his
                dream, but
                also becomes a symbol of hope and peace for the entire ninja world.</p>

            <h2 class="heading_style"> Sasuke Uchiha </h2>

            <img class="movie_post" src="images/Sasuke_Uchiha.jpg" alt="Sasuke Uchiha">

            <p>Sasuke Uchiha is a genius from the prestigious Uchiha clan, driven by a deep desire to avenge his
                family's murder
                at the hands of his older brother, Itachi. Cool, calm, and reserved, Sasuke becomes Naruto’s rival and
                teammate on
                Team 7. Though he initially forms bonds with his teammates, his obsession with power and revenge
                ultimately leads
                him to abandon the village and seek strength from darker sources. Sasuke’s journey is marked by pain and
                isolation,
                as he walks a path that contrasts sharply with Naruto’s. Despite his cold demeanor, he struggles with
                internal
                conflict and the burden of his clan’s legacy. Throughout the series, his choices shape major events in
                the ninja
                world, from his defection to his involvement in the Fourth Great Ninja War. In the end, it is his bond
                with Naruto
                that forces him to reflect and ultimately change. Sasuke’s story is one of tragedy, redemption, and the
                long road
                back from the edge.</p>

                <h3 class="heading_style">Kakashi Hatake</h3>

                <img class="movie_post" src="images/Kakashi_Hatake.jpg" alt="Kakashi Hatake">

                <p>Kakashi Hatake, the Copy Ninja, is a calm, enigmatic shinobi known for his mask, his love of Icha Icha novels, 
                    and his infamous tardiness. Despite his laid-back attitude, he’s a brilliant strategist and one of the most 
                    skilled ninja in the Hidden Leaf. As the leader of Team 7, Kakashi plays a crucial role in mentoring Naruto, 
                    Sasuke, and Sakura, teaching them not only combat skills but also the importance of teamwork and loyalty. Haunted 
                    by a tragic past filled with loss, Kakashi hides deep emotional scars beneath his composed exterior. He possesses 
                    the Sharingan in one eye, gifted to him by a fallen comrade, which becomes a symbol of both his pain and resolve. 
                    Throughout the series, Kakashi’s wisdom and combat prowess make him a vital leader in times of crisis, including 
                    the Fourth Great Ninja War. Despite his quiet nature, he earns the respect of allies and enemies alike. Eventually,
                     his strength and dedication lead him to become the Sixth Hokage, fulfilling his own unexpected destiny.</p>
