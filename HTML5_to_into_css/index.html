        <h1>Who is Naruto Uzumaki?</h1>
        <p>Naruto Uzumaki is the main character of the Naruto anime and manga series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Born in the Hidden 
            Leaf Village, Naruto started life under tragic circumstances. His parents, Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, sacrificed
            their lives to save the village from a deadly attack, sealing the Nine-Tailed Fox, Kurama, inside their newborn son. This 
            made Naruto a target of fear and resentment among villagers, leaving him to grow up lonely and isolated. Desperate for 
            attention, he often played pranks and acted out to get noticed. Despite being shunned, Naruto never gave in to hatred and
            dreamed of one day becoming Hokage—the leader and protector of his village. That goal kept him moving forward, and his journey 
            from outcast to hero would one day change the ninja world forever.

        <h2> Naruto's Personality</h2>
        <p>Naruto's personality is loud, energetic, and filled with optimism, but he's more than just a class clown. Deep down, he’s 
            compassionate and incredibly loyal to those he cares about. He strongly believes in never giving up on anyone, no matter
            how far they’ve fallen. This is especially seen in his relationship with Sasuke Uchiha, a rival turned rogue, whom Naruto 
            never stops trying to save. His unbreakable spirit, or "nindo"—his ninja way—is to never go back on his word. That belief 
            pushes him through impossible odds, from failing grades at the ninja academy to fighting world-level threats. What makes 
            Naruto special isn’t just his power but his heart. He’s someone who turns enemies into allies and wins battles through empathy 
            as much as strength.</p>
