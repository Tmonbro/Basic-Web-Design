                <h2 class="heading_style">Who is Naruto Uzumaki?</h1>
                <p>Naruto Uzumaki is the main character of the Naruto anime and manga series created by Masashi
                    Kishimoto. Born in the Hidden
                    Leaf Village, Naruto started life under tragic circumstances. His parents, Minato Namikaze and
                    Kushina Uzumaki, sacrificed
                    their lives to save the village from a deadly attack, sealing the Nine-Tailed Fox, Kurama, inside
                    their newborn son. This
                    made Naruto a target of fear and resentment among villagers, leaving him to grow up lonely and
                    isolated. Desperate for
                    attention, he often played pranks and acted out to get noticed. Despite being shunned, Naruto never
                    gave in to hatred and
                    dreamed of one day becoming Hokage—the leader and protector of his village. That goal kept him
                    moving forward, and his journey
                    from outcast to hero would one day change the ninja world forever.

                <h2 class="heading_style"> Naruto's Personality</h2>
                <p>Naruto's personality is loud, energetic, and filled with optimism, but he's more than just a class
                    clown. Deep down, he’s
                    compassionate and incredibly loyal to those he cares about. He strongly believes in never giving up
                    on anyone, no matter
                    how far they’ve fallen. This is especially seen in his relationship with Sasuke Uchiha, a rival
                    turned rogue, whom Naruto
                    never stops trying to save. His unbreakable spirit, or "nindo"—his ninja way—is to never go back on
                    his word. That belief
                    pushes him through impossible odds, from failing grades at the ninja academy to fighting world-level
                    threats. What makes
                    Naruto special isn’t just his power but his heart. He’s someone who turns enemies into allies and
                    wins battles through empathy
                    as much as strength.</p>
